This container derives from
[vcatechnology/ubuntu-ci](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/ubuntu-ci) so that the
image has the latest [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) packages. It then
installs the some useful development packages.

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/ubuntu-documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/ubuntu-documentation/)
